# UFO
##Overview of the analysis: 
This analysis aims to create a searchable webpage to look at data on UFO sightings. This will allow anyone studying them to access information quickly.

##Results:
To perform a search, one has to enter a search term in one of the five search boxes (Date,	City, State, Country, and Shape) and press enter. As seen in the following image

You can also search multiple things and, at the same time, get a particular data table. As seen in this image:

Summary:
The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage: One of the drawbacks of this webpage is that if you use any capitalizations, you don't get any of the data.
The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development
-The search should not be so sensitive to capitalizations. That would make it easier for people to find things.
-There should also be a way for people to add to the data since UFO sightings occur all the time
